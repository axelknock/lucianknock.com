An inexhausive list of every book I have ever read.

I cannot remember when I began the practice of recording which books I have read, but I find it helpful to reflect on what I have learned from books through the years.

Associated years indicate the year(s) in which I read the book, if I can recall or recorded it at the time.

I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to generate this list. By entering the International Standard Book Number (ISBN), Zotero is able to pick up the metadata on the book. This is then synced with a file in the [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) format and formatted with Hugo.
