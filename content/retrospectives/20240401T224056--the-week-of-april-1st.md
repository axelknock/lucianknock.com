[^1]: I realized this about my time-tracking: I can now try to allot my time to my various tasks and TODOs. I have previously very strictly pre-scheduled my time, but the difference will be that at any point when I am wondering what to do, I can simply ask what I still need to spend time on. Luckily my time tracker of choice, Timetagger, can help with this since it has support for goals.
