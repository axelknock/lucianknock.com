|---|----------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 1 | Ship *Unnamed Hiring Platform*                     |       |
| 2 | Meet 1 new person[^1]                              |       |
| 3 | Write one short story                              |       |
| 4 | Perform all [retrospectives](/blog/speaking-aloud) |       |

This is the first time I am starting to perform this tactic of retrospective organization, so I have quite a late start on this month.

[^1]: I am not ashamed to admit it: besides my fianc√© whom I love dearly, boss, and family, I have contact with 0 people on a regular basis. I recognize this to be extreme. I am not unhappy, nor do I have a serious expectation of what meeting *other* people would do for me. I just want to see what happens.
