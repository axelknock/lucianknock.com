## Notes
### Get a freelance gig
Didn't accomplish this, as this turned out to be a slightlier loftier goal than I anticipated. I did however become heartened when performing a competitive analysis on Upwork, which I currently understand is my best option for finding a satisfying role. The fact that I even completed a competitive analysis seems to put me ahead quite a bit, so I am hopeful that I can get interest from a potential client within the next week.

I also found a good self-hosted invoicing software, [InvoicePlane](https://www.invoiceplane.com/). Yet another instance of me working on ancilliary concerns before the main problem, but at least a task complete need not be done twice.
### Experiment with Anki for learning Latin
I have started using Anki with a particular deck, [Lingua Latina](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1896912568) by [John Lawrence Aspden](https://johnlawrenceaspden.github.io/). I have experimented with learning Latin before from the particular book this deck is based on, [Lingua Latina per se Illustrata](https://hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series). I am hoping that using a new system in addition to reading the source material will help reinforce concepts while keeping them in context.
### Finish short story
Undone, but not unworked on. I have made good promise and intend to finish it soon.
