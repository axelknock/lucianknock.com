## Notes
### Test out the naive implementation of an LLM interface
I am guilty of getting caught up in the idea of building something using technologies that are familiar. Instead I need to ask, "what is the ideal experience?" and work *backwards* from there. Sure I have seen an implementation of the naive LLM chat done in Django, but is it the best technology for my purpose?

*What is my purpose?*

I want to build an open source LLM interface. And while I read everything I can on getting better output from these expert systems, I ran through a [tutorial on how to effectively prompt](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19jzLgRruG9kjUQNKtCg1ZjdD6l6weA6qRXG5zLIAhC8/). It uses [Claude for Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/claude_for_sheets/909417792257), (which I think is being slept on). It made me realize that the most intuitive way to build great prompts would be with a graphical node system.

So I figured out what the ideal experience would be, and now I have to work backwards. Some research turned up [retejs](https://github.com/retejs/rete), which makes difficult component, a graphical node editor, readily available.
### Send proposals to potential freelance clients
I sent a few, and heard back from one. I just need to keep reaching out. I also registered a new domain since this is my personal website and I would like a business website.
### Work outside of my home
I forgot about this goal, and so I did not do it. I think on Saturdays I will start going to the nearby library for my extra work.
### Do yoga
I did a little bit of yoga. Small steps, but I will do more.
### Contribute to open source
I did not do this, but mostly because I have been caught up thinking about the problem of LLMs and how to use them effectively. [Gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel) feels like it is just scratching the surface of what is capable with an LLM, but something about its User Experience is just short of that. I keep on trying to crack through the problem in my head. Namely, how can you make using an LLM feel *effortless*?
