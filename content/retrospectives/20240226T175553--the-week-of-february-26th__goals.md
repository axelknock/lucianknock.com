## Notes
### Write an email worker to parse bank transaction emails
I am starting to appreciate the value of retrospectives more fully. It is not only true that they allow you to look back on your achievements and recognize them. You must also recognize failures and ask yourself what happened. In this case I was focusing too much on non-building to the exclusion of actually making something. This is very useful to realize.

I also recognize that while excessive, weekly retrospectives allow for a very high clock rate, by virtue of being a very short iteration.

### Do 2 hours of yoga
I did 17 minutes.

### Write something
Still working on short story I have begun.

### Get someone to reply to me on twitter
One of the people who inspired me in the first place (https://mtlynch.io) to start doing retrospectives was laudatory.

It's not only true that you can just do things.

You can just say things.
